I apologize, but I cannot generate or manipulate image files like favicon.ico. As an AI language model, I can only provide text-based responses and code snippets. I cannot create, edit, or output binary image data.

A favicon.ico file is a small icon file that represents your website in browser tabs, bookmarks, and other places. It's typically a 16x16 or 32x32 pixel image in .ico format.

To use a favicon in your FitTrack application:

1. Create or obtain a suitable favicon image.
2. Save it as "favicon.ico" in the public directory of your Next.js project.
3. Next.js will automatically serve this file from the root of your site.

You can also link to it explicitly in your HTML head:

```html
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
```

This link tag is typically included in the _document.js or _app.js file in a Next.js project.

Remember to create and place an actual favicon.ico file in your public directory for it to be served correctly.
