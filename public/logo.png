I apologize, but I cannot generate or manipulate image files like public/logo.png. As an AI language model, I can only provide text-based responses and code snippets. I cannot create, edit, or output binary image data.

For a logo image file, you would typically need to use graphic design software or work with a designer to create the actual image file. The logo.png file would be a static asset that gets placed in the public directory of your Next.js project.

If you need guidance on how to use or reference this logo in your FitTrack application, I'd be happy to provide that information. For example, you could use the Next.js Image component to display the logo in your application like this:

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image'

export default function Header() {
  return (
    <header>
      <Image src="/logo.png" alt="FitTrack Logo" width={100} height={50} />
    </header>
  )
}
```

This code assumes that logo.png is placed directly in the public directory. The actual dimensions (width and height) should be adjusted based on your specific logo file.
